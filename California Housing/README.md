# California Housing Notebook Summary

For this mini-project, i attempt to fit various algorithms to sklearn's readily available california housing to predict the house value based on various factors such as : Average number of rooms, geographical location, e.t.c

### The following models are implemented for practice purposes:
* Ridge Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Lasso
* Bayesian Ridge Regression

Finally, an ensemble model is fitted, specifically the Random Forest Regressor, and various metrics are applied to evaluate its performance.
